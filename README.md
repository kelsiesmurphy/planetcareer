<!-- REFLECTIONS -->
## Reflections
I built this app to fix a problem for myself whilst looking for junior developer roles, and wanting to work for companies that are ethical and purpose-driven. I was also tracking my job applications using Notion, and decided I could build a custom solution, and other people might want to use it too.
